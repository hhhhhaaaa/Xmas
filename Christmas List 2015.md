Nearly anything from http://theleesshop.com/index.php (I'll give you my login if you're gonna get something, I promise not to look.)
A nice calendar, preferably cartoon related.
A go pro drone.
Something to help me meditate, or be less stressed.
Money, if nothing else. Or, surprise me. I just want us all to be home and happy.
